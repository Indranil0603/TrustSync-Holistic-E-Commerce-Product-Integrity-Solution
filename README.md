## Technologies and Methodologies

### Review Enhancement Pipeline
- **Data Sources:** Flipkart and Olist product review datasets.
- **Model:** all-mpnet-base-v2 for generating 768-dimensional review embeddings.
- **Methodology:** Semantic similarity and sentiment labeling using cosine similarity with positive and negative sentiment embeddings. User-friendly feature-wise rating calculation via weighted averages.
- **Architecture Diagram:** ![review enhancement pipeline](./images/review-enhancement-pipeline.png)

### ETL Pipeline for Refund Analysis
- **Data Sources:** Amazon US order data (March 2020 â€“ December 2021) for estimating customer/seller statistics and refund patterns.
- **Methodology:** Statistical analysis for identifying sellers with faulty products, customers with high return rates, and zones with delayed deliveries based on order/refund status and delivery timestamps.

### Seller Verification Pipeline
- **Data Sources:** Images from product catalog and seller-uploaded product images.
- **Model:** CLIP Vision Transformer (ViT) to compute similarity scores between catalog and seller images.
- **Methodology:** Products are verified based on similarity scores exceeding a threshold; otherwise flagged for manual check.
